# JavaEE-REST-Example
This project is intended to show an example on how to do a Back-End application using REST. 
The following libraries were used in this application: 

* JavaEE 6.0
* EJB API 3.0
* JAX-RS API 2.0.1
* Servlet API 3.1
* JPA 2.1
* JAXB

I decided to use only Java Specifications in order to let this application be less vendor dependent.
